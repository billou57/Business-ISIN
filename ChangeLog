Revision history for Perl module Business::ISIN.

0.12 Tue Oct  9 19:17:35 BST 2001

	- Made set() method return the ISIN object, rather than the ISIN
	  as a string, to allow $isin->set("GB0004005475")->is_valid.  (Note
	  that stringification means that print $isin->set("GB0004005475")
	  still works).

	- Fixed algorithm bug and checked against thousands of ISINs.
	  Thanks to Peter Dintelmann for providing useful feedback and test
	  data.

0.10 Sat Sep 29 06:42:39 UTC 2001

	- Changed algorithm to cope with ISINs containing letters, such

	- Checked algorithm against draft copy of update of ISO 6166.
